This is a TextMate/Sublime/VS Code bundle providing language support for x86_64 assembly language in a variety of dialects (nasm/yasm/tasm/gas).

To compile the yaml sources to tmLanguage, you'll need [AAAPackageDev](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AAAPackageDev).
More information and a user guide is available on the [project page](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev).

[YASM tests](Tests/yasm-regression) are provided by [yasm-regression](https://github.com/yasm/yasm-regression) project.

You can [import](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/#_customization-adding-language-colorization-bracket-matching) this language syntax definition in your VS Code (no IntelliSense support though)!

Examples:
* ![Sublime Text with Monokai Extended Bright color scheme](./Screenshots/Sublime%20Text%203%20-%20Monokai%20Extended%20Bright.png?raw=true "Sublime Text with Monokai Extended Bright color scheme")
* ![Visual Studio Code with default Dark color theme](./Screenshots/Visual%20Studio%20Code%20-%20Dark.png?raw=true "Visual Studio Code with default Dark color theme")
